            SIMBig 2023 will take place in Mexico City, Mexico. Mexico City is
            located in the Valley of Mexico, on the central plateau.
            Tenochtitlan, originally built by the Aztecs in 1325 on an island in
            Lake Texcoco, was almost completely destroyed in the Tenochtitlan
            Asedio of 1521. It was redistributed and rebuilt to meet
            contemporary Spanish urban standards. The municipal government of
            Mexico City was established in 1524; at that time it was known as
            Mexico Tenochtitlan; however, it was officially recognised as Mexico
            City in 1585. Since then it has been the centre of Spanish-speaking
            politics, administration and finance. The Distrito Federal was
            established in 1824 after independence from Spain and remained as
            such until 2016. As a cultural destination, it is unparalleled in
            North America. With the sole exception of London, it has more
            museums than any other city in the world. The city's population
            thrives on delicious food and an exquisite culture that is a
            synthesis of many influences from outside the city's borders, not
            just the cultures that already existed.
