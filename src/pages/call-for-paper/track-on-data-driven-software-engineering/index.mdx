# Call for Papers
Software engineering is the application of engineering techniques and methods to software development. It is gaining more and more importance in research; high-reputed international conference series such as **ICSE, FSE, ASE** and **ESEM** offer dedicated venues for discussing research advancements in software engineering. Thanks to the era of data, software engineering has gained ground in many fields introducing new technologies to support most of human actions, from housework to the military.

The **DISE track** aims to provide an open forum for researchers, practitioners and educators in Peru and Latin America 

* To discuss their current work on data-driven software engineering practices
* To share experiences on the usage of data science methods and tools in solving software engineering problems and 
* To identify the main challenges on knowledge transfer between data science and software engineering communities.


## Scope and Topics
We are looking for contributions that investigate models, design principles, methods and techniques for software engineering using a data-driven approach. The track **DISE** has a broad scope, and specific topics of interest include (**but are not limited to**):

* Model-driven software engineering
* Data-driven software evolution and maintenance
* Data-driven software adaptation
* Data-driven software testing
* Data-driven requirement engineering
* Crowdsourcing for Software Engineering
* Ethical and privacy issues on data collection and exploitation in Software Engineering
* Design pattern for data-driven software engineering
* Non-functional aspects of Big Data processing
* Data analysis and exploitation for Software Sustainability
* Green Information Technology (Green IT)
* Information Technology for Green (IT for Green)
* Quality attributes of Software Architectures
* Incorporating Human Computer Interaction models, methods and tools
* Requirements engineering for interactive systems
* Engineering user experience
* Specification of interactive systems (methods, principles and tools)
* Empirical studies in Software Engineering
* AI in Software Engineering
